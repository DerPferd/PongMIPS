# PongMIPS

PongMIPS is an implementation of the classic game of Pong. This was a project I did just for fun which included learning MIPS.

## Building and running

 - Download repo
 - Open Mars4_4_no_ide.jar (under the "mars" directory) using java
 - Under "Application Control" click "Open MIPS program..."
 - Navigate to and open "main.asm".
 - Under "Application Control" click "Assemble and Run"

## Playing

Use the "W" and "S" keys to control the paddle.
The game will reset once one of you loses.
